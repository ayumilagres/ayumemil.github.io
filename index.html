    <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm an Engineer and Data Analytics professional at Freeport-McMoRan, where I currently work with enterprise operational systems data to design ETL workflows, perform descriptive analytics, support data governance, and develop interactive dashboards that help optimize large-scale mining operations.</p>

<p>Previously, I contributed as a Data Analytics Intern at DataThinkLab, where I applied advanced analytics techniques to develop business solutions across various market segments in the hospitality industry, including tailored recommendations using customer segmentation and market trend analysis.</p>

<p>I hold a Master’s degree in Business Analytics from Grand Canyon University and a Bachelor’s degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the Federal University of Ouro Preto (Brazil). In my master’s thesis, I focused on customer churn prediction by comparing machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forests, and KNN, and by analyzing how demographic factors influence customer behavior and retention.</p>

<p>I am currently enrolled in the MIT Applied Data Science Program, where I am expanding my knowledge in supervised learning, causal inference, feature engineering, and business experimentation. I work in both Python and R, have strong SQL skills, and frequently use tools such as Power BI, Databricks, and Azure to create scalable analytics solutions.</p>
