# Customer Churn - Project

This thesis project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using supervised machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of the thesis to obtain my Master’s degree in Business Analytics.

## Project Goals
- Predict which customers are at risk of churning
- Identify key drivers of customer churn
- Compare classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)
- Recommend the best-performing model for actionable business insights

## Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle and contains simulated customer demographic and behavioral data.  
*No proprietary or sensitive information is included.*

## Tools Used
- **R**
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `caret`, `dplyr`, `randomForest`, `pROC`

## Key Results
- **Logistic Regression** offered the best balance of sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for retention-focused strategies  
- **Random Forest** outperformed other models in overall **accuracy** and **F1-score** after feature selection

## Business Impact
By applying machine learning to predict churn, companies can proactively engage at-risk customers, optimize marketing efforts, and reduce revenue loss — leading to improved customer retention and ROI.
