# Customer Churn - Project

This project aims to predict customer responses to a membership offer using machine learning models. It was developed as part of the thesis to obtain my Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics.

## Project Goals
- Identify key factors that influence customer responses
- Compare classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Recommend the best model to minimize false positives and maximize campaign profitability

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained as part of the academic project and contains demographic and behavioral data of Superstore customers.

## Tools Used
- R
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `caret`, `dplyr`, `randomForest`, `pROC`

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression performed best in terms of **specificity**, minimizing false positives
- Random Forest achieved higher **accuracy** and **F1-score** after feature selection

## Business Impact
Using the best-performing model can help reduce campaign costs by targeting customers more effectively, improving overall ROI.
