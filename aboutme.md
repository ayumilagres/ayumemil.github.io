Hi! I'm **Ayume Milagres**, a data-driven engineer and analyst passionate about turning messy data into meaningful insights that drive business impact.

I hold a **Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics** from Grand Canyon University (GPA 4.0), and a **Bachelorâ€™s in Control and Automation Engineering** from the Federal University of Ouro Preto in Brazil. I bring a unique blend of technical depth and business acumen, with hands-on experience across ETL pipelines, sensor data analytics, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Currently, I work at **Freeport McMoRan** as a Dispatch Engineer, where I support and configure systems that manage mining operations in real time. My work includes building automated Power BI dashboards, writing complex SQL pipelines in Snowflake, and developing Python tools to clean and validate IoT sensor data â€” helping improve operational reliability and surface million-dollar opportunities.

Previously, I completed a data strategy internship with a Paris-based research lab, where I explored 50+ real-world analytics use cases and used R to visualize insights for business stakeholders.
